Export your Github token as an environment variable and run commands:
```bash

k3s_release create-tags -c config.json
k3s_release push-tags -c config.json
k3s_release modify-k3s -c config.json
```

## Errors

### Cache Permissions and Docker:
```bash
$ k3s_release create-tags -c config-2-26.json
> FATA[0014] failed to rebase and create tags: chown: changing ownership of '/home/go/.cache': Operation not permitted
failed to initialize build cache at /home/go/.cache: mkdir /home/go/.cache/00: permission denied 
```
Verify if the `$GOPATH/.cache` directory is owned by the same user that is running the command. If not, change the ownership of the directory:
```bash
$ ls -la $GOPATH/
> drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Dec 20 15:50 .cache
$ sudo chown $USER $GOPATH/.cache
```
